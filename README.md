# rock-paper-scissors
# Discription
# I created this project for my internship during the summer of 2022.
# I built this project inorder to pratice with Python, the languge used to create this program.
# This program allowed the user to play with the computer in rock-paper-scissors out of the best of three games.
# I learned how to import the random/math function, how to make functions and creating loops, and prompting user(you or I) for input.
# Installation
# Download Viusal Studio Code, or any Integrated Development Learning Environment(IDLE).
# You can go to my GitHub https://github.com/nolanankrum/projects/edit/master/README.md and you can can copy/paste code, "fork" the code, or simply type the code line for line.
# To run program in VS Code, click "Run Python File".
# To run with IDLE, click "Run".
# Usage
# Your choices are "r" for scissors, "p" for paper and "s" for scissors
# You must enter "r", "p", or "s" in order to have a shot at winning.
# If you eneter "f" for example, the output would be "You chose f and the computer chose s. You lost :( ".
# If you lose, output would be "Unfortunately, the computer has won the best of 3 games. Better luck next time!"
# If you win, output will be "You have won the best of 3 games! What a champ :D".
