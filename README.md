2. You must enter 'r', 'p', or 's' inorder to either tie, win, or lose to the computer. 
```
It is a tie. You and the computer have both chosen r.
```

(A side note, the computer is restricted to randomly choose only 'r', 'p', or 's', so you can still lose while entering 'r', 'p', or 's'. 
```
You chose p and computer chose s. You lost 
```

3. If you win, or lose to computer, then the program will display if you won, or lost out of three games.
```
 You have won the best of 3 games! What a champ 
```

Unfortunately, the computer has won the best of 3 games. Better luck next time!
